# Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of the School Analysis project is to get an overall school performance overview by different criteria like funding, school type, school budget, per student budget and its corelation to the passing rate, math and reading peformance. The analysis first required us to clean up the data by removing the extra prefix and suffix from the student names, remove the math and reading scores for Thomas School Ninth grade students and then get the school district analysis

* School District Analysis
* School Summary
* Categorize Bins by school size , spending ranges per student
* Find top 5 high and low performing scools
* Math and Reading scores by grade
* Performance by School Size
* Performance by School Type
* Top 5 schools
* Bottom 5 schools

Results:

Below are the snapshots of some of the results.
